/*:
 **Goal:** In this exercise, you'll write code that gives the path between two tiles using the A* algorithm.

 Your A*-Algorithm should look at each tile in the maze and assign a value to it, it's so called weight.
 A Tile's weight is equal to the distance between that tile and the initial tile, plus the distance between that tile and the destination tile.

 When you reach the destination Tile, you can just walk back
