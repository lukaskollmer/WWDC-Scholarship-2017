 **Solution:** A*-Algorithm

 This is an example implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm. It works by assigning a weight to each tile. This weight is equal to the distance between that tile and the start tile, plus the distance between that tile and the destination tile. The shortest path can be found by comparing the weights of different tiles, since shorter paths have a smaller weight.

 Tap the _Run 100x_ button to record a larger sample size. You can see that this algorithm - whilst not matching the performance of the GameplayKit implementation - does indeed solve the maze pretty fast.
