// This is used by the live maze exploration progress thing (call `markExplored()` on each tile you explored and call `maze.clearAllExploredTiles()` once you've found a path)
// The idea behind this is to have one shared SerialOperationQueue object for the entire playground, to make sure all maze exploration updated are executed in order, to visualize the progress.
