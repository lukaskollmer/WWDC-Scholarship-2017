# WWDC 2017 Scholarship project


## About:
- Topic: Pathfinding
- Idea:
  - Introduction to different pathfinding algorithms
    - How do they work/differ from each other
    - Use cases?
  - Develop a custom pathfinding algorithm (This doesn't need to be Dijkstra or A*)
  - Showcase an example implementation of A*


## ToC

1. Chapter: Introduction & Challenges
  - Introduction
  - Empty page to write custom algorithm
  - ?Empty page to write Breadth-first algorithm?

2. Chapter: Solutions
  - A* example implementation
  - ?Breadth-first example implementation?
