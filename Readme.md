# WWDC 2017 Scholarship project


## About:
- Topic: Pathfinding
- Idea:
  - Introduction to different pathfinding algorithms
    - How do they work/differ from each other
    - Use cases?
  - Develop 2 custom pathfinding algorithms, Breadth-first and a* (That's irrelevant tho, as long as it can solve the maze)
  - Showcase an example implementation of Breadth-first
  - Showcase an example implementation of A*


## ToC

1. Chapter: Introduction & Challenges
  - Introduction
  - Empty page to write Breadth-first algorithm
  - Empty page to write A* algorithm

2. Chapter: Solutions
  - Breadth-first example implementation
  - A* example implementation
